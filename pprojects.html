		<h3>My Webpage</h3>
			<p>
				I have used Khan Academy, and Code Academy to learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JS. I want to make a site where it will show the many things I am interested in and a place that shows a more indepth look at my experiences. I am constantly trying to learn something else about programming and this will be where I will add updates here. This stie will always be under construction.

		<h3>SwindleStones Parody</h3>
			<p>
				I am using C++ to make a similar game to Sorcery's game SwindleStones because it was an extremely  fun experience for me. The simplicity of how you can just roll the dice and you have guess and bet to win. This bit of randomness coupled with trying to find the right algorithm allows me to think in new ways and consider many alternatives to the simplest solution.
