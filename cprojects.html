	<i>This was my senior project where I collaborated with two other students and the TA to predict the winner of the elction. This was before Trump was a canidate.</i>
	
	<p>
		We wanted to do a combination of coding and ArcMap to show the possiblities of who will win the candidate election. We looked at numerous news sources,  fivethirtyeight.com, and watched the political events that were happening at the time. Twitter was going to be our choice of data sampling because it was a common media source that we could access. Our data sample was new and modern so there were very few articles we could use to prove that our data would be good to our TA. We were able to find a few articles that showed some correlations between tweets and how people were acting. One more thing we had to present was that we could collect a substantial amount of data which we did by learning how to use the Twitter4j api which allowed us to draw 1% of the twitter feed where we would filter and save our data. After presenting those things to the TA he gave us one tool and allowed us to use server for the duration of our project. With this tool, we were able to recieve 14000 tweets over the course of 4 weeks. The large number of tweets made it simpractical to go through each one to tell what each tweet said, as a result a second script was made to do a sentiment analysis using the Standford National Language Processor. Now that we had our data we processed it by putting it through ArcMap and Excel. Finally we did our presentationsa at the Sptatial Convention where our data showed that Hillary will win by a large margin.

	<h3>Tools used: Excel,ENVI</h3>

	<i>This was a senior project with another group of students where we gathered satellite data and used ENVI to analyze the data. </i>
	<p>
		We wanted to see how much of an effect people were having on the world and we found that Greenland's satellite pictures would be able to show it. We gathered the satellite photos from the USGS site and began sorting through the pictures to find suitable pictures. We were able to find a large area and started putting it into ENVI to analyze it. We did manual classification, and sampling to define the pixels that would correspond to the various environments in Greenland. Then from there we were able to put all the information together to get a report and presentation ready for the Spatial Convention at UCSB. We found that people were making changes to the environment and the glaciers were melting which led to the the increase in water and decrease in ice on the pictures.

	<h2 class="panel-heading text-center">ASCII Roguelike</h2>
	<h3>Tools used: Eclipse, Java</h3>
	<i>This was a class project where I worked on legacy code and improved the game engine and added to the game play</i>
	<p>
		This is the class that really inspired me to do programming. The professor gave us the freedom to make any kind of application or improve code that existed from years before. This openned a door for me and let me start one of my first game programming experiences. My partner and I were working on an old ASCII Roguelike game with the bare minimums of the game going. It had a map, monster, and a player. We were given ideas of how to improve it and we spent the quarter working and improving the game. To do this we had to learn about version control, more specifically Git and why documentation was important. We were given a tutorial on Github and from there we were able to work on our own codes and be able to merge them later. My partner  made a scoring system while I added more features into the game, monsters, and items. This was great and all but then we hit a roadblock with one of our functions since I could not get a creature to move correctly. This created a discussion with the TA and Professor of how and why documentation is good. It also showed that not all legacy code is perfect and it is good to make change and improve the code as more concepts are understood. As a result we spend the time until our deadline fixing the code, making documentation, and making debug cases. Then in the next cycle of due dates we were able to have our game have many monsters that move in unique ways, items that heal, damage, score points, and a high score system.
