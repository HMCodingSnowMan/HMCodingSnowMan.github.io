				<p>
					The University of California Santa Barbara was the beautiful paradise where I learned how to live and grow. There were many golden opportunities there to figure out where you would want to be in the future. The atmosphere inspired me to understand everything around me rather than accept them. This inspiration led me through various places in the university where I met various people, joined organizations, and got out of my comfort zone. The entire community provided many influences to teach me how to deal with life. The academic life was fast and difficult however it taught important analytical skills. The student worker life was as constant as the academic life however it presented me with the ability to be responsible for the work I do and how it affects the bigger picture. The social life taught how to express myself better since it is difficult to follow your passions if you cannot express it correctly.
