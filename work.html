	<h2 class="panel-heading text-center">ZWorld GIS Intern</h2>
	<h3>July 2015-August 2015</h3>
	<p>
		This was my post graduation internship where I worked with ArcMap to update maps and validating the Autocard information. I worked on a water district where I checked on the pipes traveling around the area, fire hydrants, and other paths. There were over 5000 attributes in the tables that needed to be checked on. One thing i got fromt his was that with so much information there is room for missing data or bad data. At that point the only thing that could be done is create a log of errors to present to the client to clarify.

	<h2 class="panel-heading text-center">Supervisor of The Arbor at UCSB</h2>
	<h3>August 2012-June 2015</h3>
	<p>
		The Arbor was my first step into the working world. I learned a number of lessons about how to deal with the various needs of the customers, coworkeres and managers. Every customer has unique needs and by working here I was able to find the various ways to help everyone to the best of my abilities. These coworkers had showed me how keeping a good atmosphere would make a good business, and happy employees because we often made compromises, to fit our schedules and kept everyone well informed about changes and news. The biggest thing I valued was that the managers had inspired me to take more iniatives and become more of a leader. I became a supervisor and delegated tasks to keep the store running at top performance. There were many days of back stocking and heavy rushes of people since we were the largest store on campus.
