		<h1>University of California Santa Barbara</h1>
		<h2>Bachaelors of Art in Geography with emphasis in GIS</h2>
					
		<p>
			The University of California Santa Barbara was the beautiful paradise where I learned how to live and grow. There were many golden opportunities there to figure out where you would want to be in the future. The atmosphere inspired me to understand everything around me rather than accept them. This inspiration led me through various places in the university where I met various people, joined organizations, and got out of my comfort zone. The entire community provided many influences to teach me how to deal with life. The academic life was fast and difficult however it taught important analytical skills. The student worker life was as constant as the academic life however it presented me with the ability to be responsible for the work I do and how it affects the bigger picture. The social life taught how to express myself better since it is difficult to follow your passions if you cannot express it correctly.

		<dl id="csList">
			<dt>Problem Solving with Python</dt>
			<dd>I had never taken a programming course until my Python class, where I began to learn the basics in programming by making a dictionary, a Scrabble helper, picture changer, and playing with cTurtle.    </dd>
					
			<dt>Problem Solving with C/C++ and Project</dt>
			<dd>In the C/C++ classes i was introduced into a new langauge and found it easier to learn now that I had background in programming. In these classes I learned about pointers and memeory allocation. I also ended up making a game in the C++ class where my team and I made a turn based rpg that was pirate themed.</dd>
					
			<dt>Problem Solving with Java</dt>
			<dd>This class our professor taught us that even though we can learn Java, years from now Java would be out of date and the best thing we could learn is how to adapt to languages fast. Since I started off with Python and C/C++, The CS courses were making this adaptablilty to be a main idea. Our proffessor wanted our expereience to be as real as possible and treated it like a project course where we would have deadlines on projects we choose to make or improve.I was improving a ASCII roguelike game.</dd>
					
			<dt>Computer Algorithms</dt>
			<dd>For this computer algorithms class I started learning the bitwise functions, logic, and we used MIPS to learn more about how the programs work. The biggest experience I got from this class was learning how to make an efficient AI. The big project in this class was a Tic-Tac-Toe game that was easy to make however, since the class was on efficiency we had to use MIPS and use as few lines as possible to make an AI that would never lose. The AI could only Tie or Win. I was able to get the logic behind it however I could not make it as efficient as the build from a few years ago.</dd>
