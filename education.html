			<p>
				The University of California Santa Barbara was the beautiful paradise where I learned how to live and grow. There were many golden opportunities there to figure out where you would want to be in the future. The atmosphere inspired me to understand everything around me rather than accept them. This inspiration led me through various places in the university where I met various people, joined organizations, and got out of my comfort zone. The entire community provided many influences to teach me how to deal with life. The academic life was fast and difficult however it taught important analytical skills. The student worker life was as constant as the academic life however it presented me with the ability to be responsible for the work I do and how it affects the bigger picture. The social life taught how to express myself better since it is difficult to follow your passions if you cannot express it correctly.

			<dl id="csList">
				<dt>Problem Solving with Python</dt>
				<dd>I had never taken a programming course until my Python class, where I began to learn the basics in programming by making a dictionary, a Scrabble helper, picture changer, and playing with cTurtle.    </dd>
					
				<dt>Problem Solving with C/C++ and Project</dt>
				<dd>In the C/C++ classes i was introduced into a new langauge and found it easier to learn now that I had background in programming. In these classes I learned about pointers and memeory allocation. I also ended up making a game in the C++ class where my team and I made a turn based rpg that was pirate themed.</dd>
					
				<dt>Problem Solving with Java</dt>
				<dd>This class our professor taught us that even though we can learn Java, years from now Java would be out of date and the best thing we could learn is how to adapt to languages fast. Since I started off with Python and C/C++, The CS courses were making this adaptablilty to be a main idea. Our proffessor wanted our expereience to be as real as possible and treated it like a project course where we would have deadlines on projects we choose to make or improve.I was improving a ASCII roguelike game.</dd>
					
				<dt>Computer Algorithms</dt>
				<dd>For this computer algorithms class I started learning the bitwise functions, logic, and we used MIPS to learn more about how the programs work. The biggest experience I got from this class was learning how to make an efficient AI. The big project in this class was a Tic-Tac-Toe game that was easy to make however, since the class was on efficiency we had to use MIPS and use as few lines as possible to make an AI that would never lose. The AI could only Tie or Win. I was able to get the logic behind it however I could not make it as efficient as the build from a few years ago.</dd>

			<h1>College Projects</h1>
			<h2>Tweeting About the Presidents Spring 2015</h2>
			<h3>Tools used: ArcMap,Excel, Java</h3>
			<i>This was my senior project where I collaborated with two other students and the TA to predict the winner of the elction. This was before Trump was a canidate.</i>
			<p>
				We wanted to do a combination of coding and ArcMap to show the possiblities of who will win the candidate election. We looked at numerous news sources,  fivethirtyeight.com, and watched the political events that were happening at the time. Twitter was going to be our choice of data sampling because it was a common media source that we could access. Our data sample was new and modern so there were very few articles we could use to prove that our data would be good to our TA. We were able to find a few articles that showed some correlations between tweets and how people were acting. One more thing we had to present was that we could collect a substantial amount of data which we did by learning how to use the Twitter4j api which allowed us to draw 1% of the twitter feed where we would filter and save our data. After presenting those things to the TA he gave us one tool and allowed us to use server for the duration of our project. With this tool, we were able to recieve 14000 tweets over the course of 4 weeks. The large number of tweets made it simpractical to go through each one to tell what each tweet said, as a result a second script was made to do a sentiment analysis using the Standford National Language Processor. Now that we had our data we processed it by putting it through ArcMap and Excel. Finally we did our presentationsa at the Sptatial Convention where our data showed that Hillary will win by a large margin.  
			</p>
			<!---
			<ul>
				<li>Customized the twitter4j API to pull from the livestream of tweets about our candidates continuously for 4 weeks onthe college server</li>
				<li>Explored the Stanford National Language Processor to do a sentiment analysis on the tweets contents</li>
				<li>Mapped the data using Excel and ArcMap to create powerful visualizations of the results</li>
				<li>Presented our findings at the Spatial Convention at UCSB Spring 2015 to staff and other experts in the field of Spatial Sciences</li>

			<h2>ASCII Roguelike</h2>
			<h3>Tools used: Eclipse, Java</h3>
			<i>This was a class project where I worked on legacy code and improved the game engine and added to the game play</i>
			<p>
				This is the class that really inspired me to do programming. The professor gave us the freedom to make any kind of application or improve code that existed from years before. This openned a door for me and let me start one of my first game programming experiences. My partner and I were working on an old ASCII Roguelike game with the bare minimums of the game going. It had a map, monster, and a player. We were given ideas of how to improve it and we spent the quarter working and improving the game. To do this we had to learn about version control, more specifically Git and why documentation was important. We were given a tutorial on Github and from there we were able to work on our own codes and be able to merge them later. My partner  made a scoring system while I added more features into the game, monsters, and items. This was great and all but then we hit a roadblock with one of our functions since I could not get a creature to move correctly. This created a discussion with the TA and Professor of how and why documentation is good. It also showed that not all legacy code is perfect and it is good to make change and improve the code as more concepts are understood. As a result we spend the time until our deadline fixing the code, making documentation, and making debug cases. Then in the next cycle of due dates we were able to have our game have many monsters that move in unique ways, items that heal, damage, score points, and a high score system.
			</p>
			<!---
			<ul>
				<li>Cultivated the use of repositories with Github </li>
				<li>Generated new enemies to increase play variability</li>
				<li>Integrated an item system into a game that would affect the characters</li>
				<li>Reorganized the existing code to be more clear and more efficient</li>
			</ul>
